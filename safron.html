            <p>Hello from Tokyo where we’ve just spent the craziest few days. We arrived in Japan a week ago and it feels like we’ve been here for a whole month. It’s been so condensed and memorable, I wouldn’t even know where to start if had to describe our whole trip, I guess unforgettable is the word.</p>
            <p>This is our last day in Tokyo (and Japan!), Zayd has already left for work and my day will basically consist of jumping out of bed, spending 35 minutes on the treadmill and walking around Tokyo to eat all the foods I haven’t tried yet which include gigantic fluffy pancakes, hokaido soft serve, takoyaki and okonomiyaki. I’ll then be practicing even more cardio while shopping around Omotesando, sounds like a good day? I cannot wait!</p>
            <span>Enjoy!</span>

            <p>Preheat the oven to 200 C. Place the aubergine and the sweet potato chunks in a large roasting tray, drizzle with a bit of olive oil and sprinkle with a bit of salt. Transfer in the oven and bake until tender and golden, about 25 to 30 minutes. Set aside until ready to use.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, in a large casserole warm the olive oil over medium-high heat and add the onions, tomatoes, tomato paste, turmeric, saffron, salt and pepper. Leave for about 10 minutes to lightly sweat the onions. Stir occasionally.</p>
            <p>Pour the vegetable stock and 1 liter of water in the casserole and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover with a lid and leave to simmer gently for 40 minutes.</p>
            <p>Transfer the chickpeas in the casserole and increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. Add the broken spaghetti as well as the roasted aubergine and sweet potato chunks, reduce to the heat to medium-low and leave to simmer until the spaghetti pieces are fully cooked, adjust the cooking time according to the manufacturer instructions.</p>
            <p>Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt if desired. Serve immediately with more parsley.</p>
